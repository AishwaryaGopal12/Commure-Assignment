    "### üè• Hospital Database Agent - Main Execution Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as the **main execution environment** for an intelligent agent designed to answer natural language questions about a hospital database.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üìå Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the functionality, integration, and usage of an AI-powered agent capable of interpreting user queries and retrieving accurate responses from a structured hospital database.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ‚öôÔ∏è Scope and Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent is currently capable of handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ‚úÖ **Basic queries** (e.g., patient names, doctor specialties, medicine stock levels etc.)\n",
    "- ‚úÖ **Intermediate queries** (e.g., rooms cleaned today, patients prescribed a capsule etc)\n",
    "- ‚úÖ **Some complex queries** (e.g., avg. time to complete an ambulance ride, patients with total billed amount for a certain period etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations**:\n",
    "- ‚ùå May struggle with highly nested or ambiguous queries\n",
    "- ‚ùå Limited understanding of external clinical knowledge or nuanced medical context. For instance, it does not know what ICD-10 codes mean even though they are present in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üß± Architecture Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation is modular, with logic split into different files for clarity and maintainability:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `lang_graph.py` ‚Äì Lang Graph defined here. The edges, nodes, control flow for graph etc.\n",
    "- `tools.py` ‚Äì Agent tools for SQL parsing, schema understanding, error handling etc.\n",
    "- `utils.py` ‚Äì General-purpose utility functions along with the function used to run tests\n",
    "- `agent.py` ‚Äì The main agent is defined here. Also the critic agent definition is in this file.\n",
    "-  `SQL_Files\\` -  Contains the SQL scripts used to populate the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run all initialization cells to load the agent and dependencies\n",
    "2. Populate the database using the SQL scripts provided in the `SQL_Files\\` folder.\n",
    "3. Provide the OPEN AI API key and TAVILY API key in the input cell.\n",
    "4. Run the main execution cell to start the agent.\n",
    "5. Use the input cell to ask natural language questions (e.g., *\"How many patients were admitted in July?\"*)\n",
    "6. Review the generated SQL and the returned results\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üß™ Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a flexible, extensible platform for interacting with hospital data using natural language. It showcases the power of combining NLP with structured data systems, and acts as a foundation for building more intelligent and clinically aware data agents.\n",

      "To get the list of all room numbers that are currently occupied, the following analysis and approach is considered:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Database Schema Understanding**:\n",
      "   - **Rooms Table**: This table includes `room_id`, `room_number`, `room_type_id`, `capacity`, `status`, and `last_serviced`.\n",
      "   - **Room_Assignments Table**: This table includes `assignment_id`, `room_id`, `staff_id`, `patient_id`, `assignment_date`, and `end_date`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Relevant Tables for Occupancy**:\n",
      "   - **Rooms Table**: Provides room-related details.\n",
      "   - **Room_Assignments Table**: Contains details about which room is assigned to which patient or staff, implying occupancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Determining Occupied Rooms**:\n",
      "   - A room is considered occupied if there's an entry in the `Room_Assignments` table where `end_date` is NULL (indicating current occupancy) and there's a valid `patient_id`.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **SQL Query Formation**:\n",
      "   - We need to join the `Rooms` table and `Room_Assignments` table on `room_id`.\n",
      "   - Filter entries in the `Room_Assignments` table where `end_date` is NULL, which signifies that the room is currently occupied.\n",
      "   - Select distinct `room_number` from the result to identify all currently occupied rooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "By examining the relationships and attributes, an appropriate SQL query can be constructed. Here's the SQL query and the explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "```sql\n",
      "SELECT DISTINCT Rooms.room_number\n",
      "FROM Rooms\n",
      "JOIN Room_Assignments ON Rooms.room_id = Room_Assignments.room_id\n",
      "WHERE Room_Assignments.end_date IS NULL\n",
      "AND Room_Assignments.patient_id IS NOT NULL;\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "- **SQL Explanation**: \n",
      "  - The `SELECT DISTINCT Rooms.room_number` ensures that unique room numbers are retrieved.\n",
      "  - The `JOIN` on `Rooms` and `Room_Assignments` is established using `room_id`.\n",
      "  - The `WHERE` clause checks for `Room_Assignments.end_date IS NULL` to identify currently occupied rooms.\n",
      "  - `AND Room_Assignments.patient_id IS NOT NULL` ensures that the room's occupancy is related to a patient, thus confirming it is occupied.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Tables Used**: Rooms, Room_Assignments\n",
